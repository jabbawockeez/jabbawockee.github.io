### pay the price
to suffer the consequences of someoneâ€™s actions
1. There's a price to pay since we use the indexes a lot in the project.
2. You'll have to pay the price if you punch other kids face in.


### get sth out of the way
to finish doing something, especially something difficult or unpleasant
1. I really want to go see the movie with you, but I have to get my homework out of the way first.
2. Let's get these problems out of the way quickly so that we can have enough time to work on the worthiest stuff.
3. I set a goal to write a journal on the morning so even though I'm very busy I would get this out of the way first.


### pull an all-nighter
1. I know that pull an all-nighter is not good for health, but I have no choice, it's been a hectic day and I don't have enough time to do my own stuff.
2. I didn't sleep a wink last night, I pulled an all-nighter.
